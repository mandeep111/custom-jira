🗂️ Custom Jira/ClickUp Project Management Application

Project Management API is a minimal yet feature-rich clone of ClickUp and Trello, built entirely with Java Spring Boot.
It provides a solid backend foundation for managing workspaces, projects, tasks, teams, and collaboration workflows — everything you’d expect from a modern project management tool.
